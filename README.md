# uploader
Welcome to **Uploader**! Uploader is a static file zone/area. 

#how to deploy
Simply deploy the contents of the **f** folder (*make sure it is in it's own folder because the files are uploaded in the subfolders there*) on a webserver and head to the main folder you put the contents in. 

#demo
You can test it out on your own here (please don't spam, demo purposes only): [here](http://f.kunet.party).
